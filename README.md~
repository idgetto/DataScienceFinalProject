# Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering Course Finder

Authors: Isaac Getto, Jee Hyun Kim, TJ Kim

We are students at Olin College taking the SP16 Data Science course. For our final project for the semester, we are developing an online tool students can use in order to streamline their course selection process when registration season comes by.

## Directory

### cleaning
The 'cleaning' folder includes ipython notebooks on cleaning the original dataset we had. We opted to divide the original csv file into new multiple csv files, each with convenient components. Each csv file serves a purpose in the data exploration and statistical analysis phase throughout the project.

### explore
The 'explore' folder takes the csv files from the 'cleaning' folder and expands on them. This folder includes the very basic brainstorming and rough explorations in order for us to get familiar with the data.

### ml
In the 'ml' (machine learning) folder, explore the machine learning component of the registration process. So far, we explore clustering, observing how different trends arise in the data, and organizing them in a spatial aspect. We also try to predict what major a student is based on the classes the student takes.

### statanalysis
The 'statanalysis' folder holds the bulk of our work. Here we statistically approach the historical registration patterns and dig out statistical values such as mean, standard deviation, p-values, and such. Our goal is to inform the user with objective numbers to help guide their decisions.

### flask
Our attempt at applying the machine learning for major prediction. We used it mostly as an extension exploration in association with our machine learning process.
